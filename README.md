## 🎮 how to play
- **Choose an Action**:  
  you'll be prompted to choose how to interact with your cat:  
  - `feed`: keep hunger levels up!  
  - `brush`: groom your cat and boost hygiene.  
  - `play`: have fun and keep care levels high.  
  - `interact`: enjoy a random moment with your cat.  

- **watch for stats**:  
  your cat has three main stats:  
  - **Hunger**: goes down if you forget to feed them.  
  - **Hygiene**: cats need brushing to stay clean.  
  - **Care**: cats need your attention and love!  

- **don’t neglect your cat**:  
  stats decrease over time. if all three hit 0, your cat may wander off to find another home! 😿
